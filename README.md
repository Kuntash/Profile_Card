This is the desktop version, the mobile version is in process.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Learned that it was possible to use two images in background, how to position background images, shape outside, various media queries etc.

```css
background: url("/images/bg-pattern-top.svg"),
  url("/images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg"), var(--dark-cyan);
background-position: -19.7916667vw -69.5833333vh, 50.1388889vw 51.8055556vh;
```

### Continued development

Currently I need to focus more on layouts, positioning, grids etcetera.
